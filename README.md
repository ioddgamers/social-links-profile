After I ran into some problems (making my webpage responsive) with my recipe page project, I was advised by someone in the Frontend mentor community to take a mobile first, desktop next approach
which I did and I am so pleased with how it turned out. Learning something new in the community and applying it, and eventually getting results is so rewarding. 

In this project, I made it responsive for both mobile and desktop and I was also able to add a little animation to the buttons when hovered over, something I had never done.
